# rtos4avr

This is a simple real-time operating system for the ATmega328P microcontroller.  It should be fairly easy to port it to other 8-bit AVRs.

The code was kept simple since it was written as a learning exercise.  Hopefully the simplicity will make it easy to learn from, and to adapt as needed.
